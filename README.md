- 👋 Hi, I’m @AstroClef
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Project Management!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C#, and position myself as a Technical Project Manager. *Unreal is looking pretty tasty too!*
- 💞️ I’m always looking to learn and collaborate where ever I can to practice my development skill set.
