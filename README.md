- 👋 Hi, I’m @AstroClef
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Project Management and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C#, and the Unity game engine. Unreal is looking pretty tasty too!
- 💞️ I’m always looking to learn and collaborate where ever I can to practice my development skill set.
